Welcome To Dask-Xarray Examples
===============================

This is a live session from which you can run some example notebooks showing how to use Dask and Xarray.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask `Client` (these are already written for you).

To get started, double click on a notebook on the left, like `Climate_Change_1_with_xarray.ipynb`, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

Support
-------

Links are available within each notebook for additional documentation on that topic.
